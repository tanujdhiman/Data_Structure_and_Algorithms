## Stack as Abstract Data Type :

In order to make a stack we need a pointer to the top most element along with the other elements which are stored inside the stack.

**Operations :**
1. Push() - Push or insert an element to an stack
2. Pop() - Remove element from stack but always when we said pop an element from stack it is the top most element of stack. 
3. Peak() - Value at given index or position ( it is specified ).
