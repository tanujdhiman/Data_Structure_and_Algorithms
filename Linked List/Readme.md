This folder contains all linked list program. 
* Creation
* Traversing
* Insertion

But remeber these are not four, these programs have a lot of sub pragrams like insertion is not just a insertion it contains insertion at end, at beginning etc.

Yeah, you know linked list is of three types :
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List

Note :-  One more type we have **Doubly Circular Linked List**.

## Singly Linked List :

Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
