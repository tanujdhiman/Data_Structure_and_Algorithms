This folder contains all linked list program. 
* Creation
* Traversing
* Insertion
* Deletion

But remeber these are not four, these programs have a lot of sub pragrams like insertion is not just a insertion it contains insertion at end, at beginning etc.

Yeah, you know linked list is of three types :
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List

Note :-  One more type we have **Doubly Circular Linked List**.

## Singly Linked List :

Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

## Doubly Linked List :

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

## Circular Linked List :

Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.


In this repositary I have made programs for **Singly Linked List** only but don't worry. If you guys have understood it very well then you can do by your own.

Hope you guys will enjoys!!!!!!!!!
