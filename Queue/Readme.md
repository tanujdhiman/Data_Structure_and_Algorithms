# Queue

**Queue** is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).  A good example of queue is INDIAN RAILWAY STATION Counter where all the passengers are stand in a line of ticket counter. First person name RAHUL came for some station ticket and after that passengers continously in the line. So this is a example of queue because First person RAHUL came so he will get ticket first then all from RAHUL. So there is a approach here **FIRST COME FIRST OUT**

The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

## Operations on Queue:

Important operation on Queue is : 
* Enqueue
