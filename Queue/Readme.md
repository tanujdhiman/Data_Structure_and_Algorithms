# Queue

**Queue** is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).  A good example of queue is INDIAN RAILWAY STATION Counter where all the passengers are stand in a line of ticket counter. First person name RAHUL came for some station ticket and after that passengers continously in the line. So this is a example of queue because First person RAHUL came so he will get ticket first then all from RAHUL. So there is a approach here **FIRST IN FIRST OUT**

The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

## Operations on Queue:

Important operation on Queue is : 
* Enqueue
* Dequeue
* Front
* Rear
* Peek(pos)
* isEmpty( )
* isFull( )

#### EnQueue :

We all know when talking about a Queue is just a Railway Station Ticket counter line where first person came and then he will get first ticket then after other. It is just like a First Come First Server Approach. So other person must be insert in the line from the end only. Exactly in Queue we can only insert element from End of Queue only. When we do inertion operation in Queue at end then it is called EnQueue Operation.

#### DeQueue :

As Enqueue is inserting at the end of the Queue then Dequeue is Deleting from Start of the Queue. Example :- Through the Previous example Railway Station Conter line we all know when first person named Rahul came then obiviously he will get the ticket first so that he will get ticket then he will be removed exactly the same procedure here. First Element will come then it will removed first and this approach here is First Come First Out.
